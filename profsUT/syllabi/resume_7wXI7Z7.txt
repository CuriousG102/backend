INTERESTS

Outside of school, I am fascinated by the intersection of technology and art through the context of creative coding. I enjoy programming generative artworks and exploring alternative methods of interfacing users’ actions with the software. Furthermore I am currently in the process of directing a short movie and composing the accompanying music.
